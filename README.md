# Descriptive-Genres
###### There has been a lot of work done on classifying genres of musical tracks based on their features. 
###### However, telling the genre of a song is subjective. Also, a genre can be very wide to tell how song is and even though it might help the listener up to some extent it proves to be of no use in exactly entertaining the listeners as per their mood.  
###### This project is motivated by the very fact that if the listeners can listen to the songs based not just on broad features but on descriptive features exactly aligning to their mood, they, can have a great experience. 


### Models Used 


###### In order to achieve this goal of obtaining descriptive genres, we have implemented certain machine learning algorithms.  
#### K-Means Clustering:  
###### K-means clustering has been implemented on all the tracks to cluster the tracks based on audio features like acousticness, energy, danceability, valence, tempo and so on.  
###### Further, the clustering has also been done for only the electronic tracks to make our descriptive genres more specific.  
#### Hierarchical Clustering: 
###### In order to compare our clustering results, hierarchical clustering is also performed on the tracks.  
#### Principle Component Analysis: 
###### Principle Component Analysis have been applied on the multi-dimensional clustered data set for better visualisation of the determined clusters.
